### Computational Thinking in Social Studies

Welcome to episode three of the Infusing Computing webseries.

This episode is a Focus On The Content Area. This is a look at connecting with computational thinking (CT) from a disciplinary perspective.

In this episode, weâ€™ll look at CT in the social studies classroom.

- What do SS & CT look like?
- Standards and content that fits in nicely
- Difference between SS & History?
- Thinking about document based questions (DBQs).
- A DBQ is an algorithm
- Writing a thesis statement is a formula
- The CT elements of PRADA fit well into SS
- Try and identify pattern recognition into unit
