### Implementation Successes and Barriers

Welcome to episode ten of the Infusing Computing webseries.

This episode is focused on Infusing Computational Thinking. This is a deep dive into what is computational thinking (CT), and how to embed it in instruction.

In this episode, we'll look at some of the challenges and opportunities that teachers have experienced as they've strived to embed computational thinking in instruction. 

In this episode, we discuss the use of CS Unplugged activities as a way to get started thinking about integration. https://csunplugged.org/en/
