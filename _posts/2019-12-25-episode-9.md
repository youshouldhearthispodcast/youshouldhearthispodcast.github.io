### December Water Cooler

There is a new [help section](https://www.infusingcomputing.com/help-section.html) on the website for a variety of purposes. Specifically, you can contact the support team if you're looking for getting your students into SNAP, or uploading completed materials. You'll also find more resources, a link to the Slack webseries channel, and newsletter.

Be sure to check out the Slack channel for more "just in time" support. 

We plan to offer a stipend for project participants as they listen and respond to podcasts.

Lastly...record, record, record. Reach out if individual need.

Stipends coming in the next few weeks.
