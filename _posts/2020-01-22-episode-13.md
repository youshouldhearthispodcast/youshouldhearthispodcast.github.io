### January Water Cooler

There is a new [help section](https://www.infusingcomputing.com/help-section.html) on the website for a variety of purposes. Specifically, you can contact the support team if you're looking for getting your students into SNAP, or uploading completed materials. 

We also talk a bit about what to complete and upload when you're done. 

Be sure to check out the Slack channel for more "just in time" support.
