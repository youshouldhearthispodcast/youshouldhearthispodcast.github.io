### What is assessment in computational thinking?

Welcome to episode two of the Infusing Computing webseries.

This episode is focused on Infusing Computational Thinking. This is a deep dive into what is computational thinking (CT), and how to embed it in instruction.

In this episode, we'll look at assessment embedded in computational thinking. 

- What is assessment?
- What does assessment look like with CT?
- What are some challenges/opportunities with assessment & CT?
- What does this look like? What can I do right now?
- Google and ISTE assessment resources
- Infusing computing website resources
