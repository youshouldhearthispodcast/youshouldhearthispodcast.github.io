### Storyboarding as a gateway into computational thinking 

Welcome to episode six of the Infusing Computing webseries.

This episode is focused on Infusing Computational Thinking. This is a deep dive into what is computational thinking (CT), and how to embed it in instruction.

In this episode, we'll look at the connections between storyboarding and animation in computational thinking.
