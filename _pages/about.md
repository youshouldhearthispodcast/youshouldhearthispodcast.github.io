Infusing Computing is an NSF-funded research program delivering computing-infused, STEM-focused professional development to middle and high school teachers in order to improve computing learning across North Carolina and South Carolina. 

The purpose of this podcast is to help disseminate materials from the project more accessible and approachable for all. We figued that no one would pay attention to webinars. We also believe that webinars are generally only of interest to project participants...but we wanted to make all of these materials available for anyone that would be interested. So...we rolled up our sleeves and reimagined our dissemination as an open podcast. So welcome to the podcast!

### Our Goal

The goal of Infusing Computing is to provide interdisciplinary, computing-infused professional development for 360 middle and high school teachers in North Carolina and South Carolina. Participants learn how to incorporate computing into the content area in ways that support and enhance their state and district curriculum.

Our primary research question is: How do professional development contexts (individual or team, school type) and cultures (discipline, state) impact the quality, implementation, and equitable access to STEM curricula integrated with computing?

The end result is a podcast series that focuses on four segments:
- Infusing Computational Thinking: What is computational thinking (CT) and the PRADA model?
- Focus on the Content Area: What does CT look like as embedded in the disciplines?
- Report from the Field: Short discussions with teachers from the project as they embed CT and PRADA in their classrooms.
- Water Cooler: News, notes, tips, and tricks about the project.

### The People

Our project is led by a collective is led by a collaborative research team from NC State and The Citadel. You can learn more about us at [our website](https://www.infusingcomputing.com/program-overview.html).
